# C# Squawk Code Generator

A transponder code, more commonly known as a "Squawk code" is a 4-digit number whose digits range from 0-7 whose purpose is to identify aircraft flying in an airspace. This program uses the .NET built-in pseudo-random number generator to generate these codes. ***THIS PROGRAM IS FOR SIMULATION USE ONLY!***

## Features

The program regenerates the code if it:
    Is equal to 7500, 7600, or 7700
    Has already beed generated in program runtime to avoid redundancy

The program allows the user to clear the list from inside the program using a `Console.ReadKey()` method and a case switch. The program also uses this case switch to allow the user to stop execution from inside the program.

## Prerequisites

This program requires the .NET 6.0 Runtime/SDK, as well as a computer capable of running .NET 6.0.
